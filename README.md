# Collegium
Collegium is an intra-college professional network of student and faculties which would provide students(undergraduate, postgraduate and even alumnus) and faculties to showcase their work and achievements amongst the college crowd. It would be a huge database of information which could be accessed by students and faculties alike and would also be visible to the professionals, academicians and industrialists outside the college.

##Goal of the project:

Under this project, our aim is to build a intra-college professional network and provide free search based on skills, interests, internships and projects and much more between faculties and students. This platform would also act as a bridge between the enormous world of professional opportunities and not so very industrially experienced college crowd.


##Implementation:

Our project consists of two parts:

###Frontend: 
    There will be seven pages in our projects.These are:
    1.Admin Page
    2.Main Page
    3.Faculty Template
    4.Student Template
    5.Home Page
    6.Sign Up
    7.Account creation or Login

    We would be using different Apiâ€™s to make it viable and lightweight.For Javascript in website rendering,we would be using node.js along with angular.js and react.js.
    Node.js also has database handling properties,and we will be integrating db through sqlite and django.

    Rest api is also one other option.


###Backend: 
    We have designed Relational model and EER model with  some minor corrections(still to be needed).
